          <p>
              Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative
              lyricism, which often takes inspiration from her personal life, has received widespread critical
              praise and media coverage.
              Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2004 to pursue
              a career in country music. She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous debut studio
              album in 2006, which included the singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song".<br> Swift rose to
              mainstream prominence with her second studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with
              crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was
              certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio
              album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles
              "Mine" and "Back to December".
